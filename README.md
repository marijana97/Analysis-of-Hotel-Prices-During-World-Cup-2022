# Analysis-of-Hotel-Prices-During-World-Cup-2022
**The 2022 FIFA World Cup** was an international football tournament played from **November 20th to December 18th, 2022 in Qatar**. Qatar was visited by about *1.5 million tourists*, and hotel companies took advantage of this. Due to the increased demand for accommodation, hotel companies increased their **accommodation prices**. 

On the example of *Banyan Tree Doha At La Cigale Mushaireb in Doha*, we will analyze the room prices in the period **from November 18th to December 23th**. The collected prices refer to accommodation for *two people with breakfast*. The hotel has *2 types of standard rooms, 4 types of suite and 5 types of residence*. In this analysis, data was collected for only **5 categories of rooms**, 2 standard rooms and 3 apartments:

- Urban Retreat (Standard Room)
- Serenity Retreat (Standard Room)
- Urban Suite (Suite)
- Serenity Club Suite (Suite)
- Harmony Horizon Club Suite (Suite)

It should be noted that there are many **missing values**. Missing values in this analysis mean that that room category was **not available** for booking on a certain day and therefore the price was not displayed. The percentage of missing values for each room category is between *33% and 50%* of entire values in a column. In this analysis we will try to **fill in all missing values** with the *estimated prices* that we will get based on prices from other room categories that don't have missing values.
